                                <p>
                                   An innovative energy-tech leader partnered with us at Rovamo to solve a fundamental disconnect in the property sector: portfolio managers lacked the real-time data to make effective, large-scale energy efficiency investments, while residents lacked the personalized insights to reduce their own consumption. This data gap resulted in inefficient spending, missed ESG targets, and disengaged tenants. Our challenge was to design and develop a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that would bridge this divide. We created Enerlytics, a sophisticated, dual-sided platform that provides a strategic command center for property managers and a personalized energy hub for residents, creating a powerful, symbiotic ecosystem for driving down costs and carbon emissions.
